C# and SQL Movie Library


My Prior knowledge in C# and SQL is little to none. This was a beginner project I did on my new Mac (M1 Chip). The M1 chip complicated things greatly.
Visual Studio 2019 on the Mac ARM specifically is not optimized and is missing many features. This lead me to use JetBrains Rider for the C# visualization
and enviroment. 
I made a Local MSSQL database that I loaded with a movie.csv file I found. I used the Database tab in the Rider IDE to make the connection and
created a connectionString. Next I created a Movie class and a Movie data file, one for the Model and one for the Database loop read. 

My main references for this project were [O'REILLY C# 8.0 in a Nutshell and C# 5.0 in a Nutshell] as well as this video on how to set up the MSSQL database
for the new M1 chip. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWBNCWxD_0c
